# Stella Auto Ping
This is an android application that constantly ping a specific mac address that was configured to be targetted.
This only pings within the local network to see if they are connected or disconnected from the network.

This is used along with discord-iot-bot to control a room switches depending on if they are connected
to the network or not to identify their presence in the room.
